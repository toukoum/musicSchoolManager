Registration for instrument discovery sessions

A music school organizes instrument discovery sessions for children.
Sessions are Wednesday, Friday and Saturday only. A child has at most three
registrations, you cannot choose the same instrument several times and you cannot
participate in several sessions on the same day.
We want to know:

— for each child, the instruments chosen as well as the corresponding day of the session;
— for each instrument and for each day, the list of registered children.


It's a practical work in School to use Binary Serialisation and hashmap.
